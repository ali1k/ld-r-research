Figures are to be numbered and to have a caption which should always be positioned <em>under</em> the figures, in contrast to the caption belonging to a table, which should always appear <em>above</em> the table.</p>
                                    <p>Captions are set in 9-point type. If they are short, they are centered between the margins. Longer captions, covering more than one line, are justified (Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 show examples). Captions that do not constitute a full sentence, do not have a period.</p>
                                    <p>Text fragments of fewer than four lines should not appear at the tops or bottoms of pages, following a table or figure. In such cases, it is better to set the figures right at the top or right at the bottom of the page.</p>

The numbers in the bibliography section are without square brackets. We prefer numbered references to other styles of references, such as those with abbreviated names and years.</p>

                                    <p>Please write all references using the Latin alphabet. If the title of the book you are referring to is, e.g., in Russian or Chinese, then please write (in Russian) or (in Chinese) at the end of the transcript or translation of the title.</p>
                                    <p>In order to permit cross referencing within SpringerLink, and eventually between different publishers and their online databases, Springer standardizes the format of the references. This feature aims to increase the visibility of publications and facilitate academic research. Please base your references on the examples given in the references section of these instructions. References that do not adhere to this style will be reformatted at our end.</p>

                                    <p>We would like to draw your attention to the fact that references to LNCS proceedings papers are particularly often reformatted due to missing editor names or incomplete publisher information. This adjustment may result in the final papers as published by Springer having more pages than the original versions as submitted by the authors. Here is an example:</p>

                                    <p>Reference as formatted in author’s original version:</p>

                                    <p>Reference after reformatting by Springer:</p>

                                    <p>One more line is needed for this reference, as a result of Springer’s adjustment.</p>

The production team at SPS checks the format of the paper, and if, for example, vertical spacing has been inserted or removed, then this is remedied. In addition, running-heads, final page numbers, and a copyright line are inserted, and the capitalization of the headings is checked and corrected if need be.

The contact author is asked to check through the final PDF to make sure that no errors have crept in during the transfer or preparation of the files. This should not be seen as an opportunity to update or copyedit the paper, which is not possible due to time constraints. Only errors introduced during the preparation of the files will be corrected. Particular attention should be paid to the references section.</p>

                                    <p>If SPS does not receive a reply from a particular contact author, within the timeframe given (usually 72 hours), then it is presumed that the author has found no errors in the paper.
